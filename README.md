# Programing-Practice

This is only for myself. It's where I'm placing my projects that I use to give myself a goal while I'm learning a language. If people wish to follow along they can, but I will NOT be accepting pull requests or merges to this repository.

Current projects and goals

openlibrary; Set up a basic library management system. Have it be connected to a database to track both books and users. If implementation takes a short enough time also add in a service to allow searching via a website(stretch goal / extra credit). 

runlevel0; A very dumb idea.
Background: I don't like SystemD. It goes agaisnt a LOT of what is Unix philosophy. And I'm even less of a fan of Leonard Pottering. God complexes in Linux are not out of the norm. But you gotta earn you're godhood. Leonard hasn't.
What is the purpose of runlevel0? To avoid confusion with this projects name. Runlevel0 is supposed to be the first thing that the linux kernel runs, and is responsible to starting programs. Thats. it. Colloqially know as an init system. So, can I write a run level 0 to replace a very, very tiny functionality of SystemD? It should be a wild trip, that's for sure.
